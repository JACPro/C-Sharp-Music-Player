# C# Music Player

## Intro

This is a basic music player application I built to further my understanding and experience of programming in C#. It is a prototype application that was swiftly developed using Windows Forms in Visual Studio.

I used a [reference video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjmU28ukjwA&feature=youtu.be "Creating a Music Player App in C# in 25 Minutes") to help guide my learning in this project.
